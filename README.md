# EEG Signal Cleaning Pipeline Management: EEGLAB-based
* Convenient GUI-based EEG pre-processing pipeline management system;
* EEGLAB processing elements can be selected as the pipeline building blocks;
* To build a pipeline, the pipeline building blocks can be easily added, removed or moved between the pipeline elements;
* A standard or previously-constructed pipeline can be loaded at once;
* The parameters of each of the pipeline building blocks can be easily adjusted;
* The designed pipeline can be applied to a set of datasets that is imported by the user, therefore the same pipeline has been applied to all datasets in an automatic way.
